our example, it will just be the host. This command will upgrade the Operating
System packages for all of your machines.

Here is the command that should ping your   webservers. Just run this command
from this directory:

ansible webservers -a 'sudo yum update -y'

To get more verbose output, use the `-v` (verbose) option, which can be
specified multiple times.

Try:

    ansible webservers -vv -a 'sudo yum update -y'

or:

    ansible webservers -vvv -a 'sudo yum update -y'
